# Running comfyui on Intel ARC140V
Using the Intel pytorch tools it is possible to run several ComfyUI example workflows on the Intel ARC140V GPU. It often gets stuck and a restart of the server is required - but generally it's possible to create some content.

# Installation - Anaconda Windows
Basially, I was Doing the "Manual Install - Intel GPU - Option 2" from the ComfyUI Github Readme (https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI?tab=readme-ov-file#intel-gpus-windows-and-linux). Instead of the pip command from the ComfyUI Readme follow the link to the Intel installation instructions (https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/installation?platform=gpu).
